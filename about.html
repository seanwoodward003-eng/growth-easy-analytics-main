    <h1>About GrowthEasy AI</h1>

    <section class="about-section" id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>GrowthEasy AI is an innovative AI-powered platform designed to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) optimize their growth strategies through advanced analytics and actionable insights. Founded in 2025, our mission is to democratize access to high-level growth tools that were previously only available to large enterprises. By integrating with platforms like Shopify and Google Analytics 4 (GA4), we provide real-time data on key metrics such as churn, acquisition, retention, revenue, and overall performance.</p>
      <p>Our cyberpunk-inspired design isn't just aesthetic—it's meant to make data visualization exciting and intuitive, turning complex numbers into clear, neon-glowing insights that drive decision-making.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section" id="our-story">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>GrowthEasy AI was born out of a frustration with traditional analytics tools that are either too expensive, too complicated, or too slow for SMBs. Our founder, Sean, a seasoned entrepreneur with experience in e-commerce and AI, saw the gap in the market during his time managing Shopify stores. He realized that many SMB owners were losing thousands in revenue due to undetected churn or inefficient acquisition channels. In early 2025, Sean assembled a small team of AI experts and developers to create a solution that leverages cutting-edge AI models like GPT-4o-mini for predictive analytics and personalized recommendations.</p>
      <p>Starting as a beta product, GrowthEasy AI has already helped over 50 beta users recover £10,000+ in lost revenue through simple, one-click actions like win-back emails and upsell campaigns. We're bootstrapped and founder-led, focused on delivering value without the bloat.</p>

    <section class="about-section" id="how-it-works">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>At the core of GrowthEasy AI is our proprietary AI engine that pulls data from your Shopify and GA4 accounts (with your permission, of course). Here's the process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Connect your accounts in seconds via secure API keys.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Our AI processes metrics like churn rate, acquisition cost, retention rate, revenue trends, and performance ratios.</li>
        <li><strong>Insights & Recommendations:</strong> Get real-time dashboards with neon visualizations, charts, and AI-generated tips (e.g., "Send a 20% off email to 18 at-risk customers to save £2,400").</li>
        <li><strong>Actions:</strong> One-click tools for emails, reports, and optimizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> The AI improves with your data (anonymized and secure), providing increasingly accurate forecasts.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We use models from OpenAI and custom algorithms to ensure 99% accuracy in predictions, with data stored securely in encrypted databases compliant with GDPR.</p>
